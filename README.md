Project Name: Nutritionist_Generative_AI_Doctor

Project Description:

This project builds a user-friendly AI-powered nutrition assistant application named "Nutritionist_Generative_AI_Doctor." It leverages computer vision and deep learning to analyze food images uploaded by the user. The model classifies the food item and provides comprehensive nutritional information, including:

Healthiness Score: Assesses the food's overall healthfulness based on established nutritional guidelines.
Calorie Count: Estimates the number of calories present in the food.
Macronutrients: Breakdown of protein, carbohydrates, and fats per serving.
Micronutrients: (Optional) Levels of vitamins, minerals, and other essential micronutrients (depending on model capabilities).
Additional Information: (Optional) May include details such as dietary fiber content, glycemic index, and potential allergens.
This application empowers users to make informed dietary choices by readily understanding the nutritional content of their food.

Key Features:

Image Recognition: Analyzes food images using computer vision to identify the type of food.
Nutritional Analysis: Provides detailed nutritional information about the recognized food.
Healthiness Score: Guides users by indicating the food's health benefits or potential drawbacks.
